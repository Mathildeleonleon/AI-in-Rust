### [Leibniz formula for π](./pi_leibniz_estimation.rs)
One of the simplest ways to estimate Pi is the Gregory-Leibniz series. Though not very efficient, it will get closer and closer to pi with every iteration, accurately producing pi to five decimal places with 500,000 iterations:

π = (4/1) - (4/3) + (4/5) - (4/7) + (4/9) - (4/11) + (4/13) - (4/15) ...
