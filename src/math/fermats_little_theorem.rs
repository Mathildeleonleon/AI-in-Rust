/// Implements Fermat's Little Theorem for probabilistic primality testing.
///
/// Fermat's Little Theorem states that if `p` is a prime number, then for any integer
/// `a` such that `1 < a < p`, it holds that:
///
/// ```text
/// a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p)
/// ```
///
/// This function tests if the given number `p` is prime by selecting `k` random integers `a`
/// in the range `[2, p-1]` and checking if the above condition holds. If it fails for any `a`,
/// the number is classified as composite. However, if it passes for all chosen values, it is
/// considered likely prime.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `p`: The number to test for primality (u64).
/// - `k`: The number of random tests to perform (u32). More tests provide a higher confidence level.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// `true` if `p` is likely prime, `false` if `p` is composite.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// The function does not panic but will return false for inputs less than or equal to 1.
///
/// # Note
///
/// This method can classify some composite numbers as prime. These are known as Carmichael numbers.
///
/// ## Carmichael Numbers
///
/// Carmichael numbers are composite numbers that satisfy Fermat's Little Theorem for all integers
/// `a` that are coprime to them. In other words, if `n` is a Carmichael number, it will pass the
/// Fermat primality test for every `a` such that `gcd(a, n) = 1`. Therefore, Carmichael numbers can
/// fool Fermat's test into incorrectly identifying them as primes. The first few Carmichael numbers
/// are 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, and 6601.
